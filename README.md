# Steam common games

Whats this crap? Its a site to compare steam game libraries and find common games to play

## Where can I use it?

[https://games.sigkill.me/](https://games.sigkill.me/)

## Is this project dead?

Probably. I might continue developing it if someone asks for a certain feature or if I can be bothered to do anything on my own volition. Ideally I would like to rewrite the frontend first into something better than the hacky jquery crap that it is now and then tidy up the backend too.
